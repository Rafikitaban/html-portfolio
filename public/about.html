    <br/>
          <p>Hi, my name is Daisy, a passionate web developer with a love for creating innovative solutions that make a difference.</p><br/>
            
          <p>I have honed my skills in HTML and CSS and I am dedicated to continuously learning and evolving in this ever-changing field</p> <br/>

          <h3>My Journey</h3> <br/>
          <p>My journey in web development began in 2022 but accelerated when joined Power Learn Project, in May 2024 </p> <br/>
            
          <p>Since then, I have had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects that have challenged me to push the boundaries of creativity and technical excellence.</p> <br/>

          <h3>Beyond Work</h3> <br/>
          <p>When I'm not immersed in a project, you can find me either reading or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/daisy_bustani/" alt ="instagram">cycling</a></p><br/>

          <p>These activities not only recharge me but also inspire fresh ideas and perspectives that I bring into my professional work</p> <br/>

          <h3>Let's Connect</h3> <br/>
          <p>I'm always excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities.</p> <br/>
