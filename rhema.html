    <h1>My Experience at Rhema Flowers </h1>  <br/>
    <p> I joined <a href="https://rhemaflowers.com/"> Rhema Flowers</a> at September 2023. My initial goal was to give this SME a digital presence and create a reputable digital footprint for the business. </p>  <br/>

    <p>Since then, some of the achievements I've accomplished include: 
        <ul>
            <br/>
            <li> Created a new logo and brand colors for Rhema </li> <br/>
            <li> Established social media accounts for the business (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rhemaflowersltd">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rhema_flowers/"> Instagram)</a> </li>  <br/>
            <li> Established GMB (Google My Business) for Rhema</li>  <br/>
            <li> Developed the first website using wordpress
                 <br/>
                 <img src="./assets/images/Screenshot (2).png" height="200" alt=" rhema homepage wordpress"></li> <br/>

            <li> Was part of the team that developed Rhema's current Website (still developed by wordpress but looks way better than what I did alone) </li>  <br/>
            <li> Incorporated and integrated basic SEO and analaytics (both for google and social media) </li>  <br/>
            <li> Still working at Rhema as the Digital Marketing Manager and so far, I've written some few <a href="https://rhemaflowers.com/blog/"> blogs </a> </li>
             <br/>
        </ul>
